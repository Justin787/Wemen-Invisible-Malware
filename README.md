# Wemen-Invisible-Malware
This program is meant to be disguised as an internet browser shortcut.  After 30 seconds, it creates a windows support popup that cannot be closed, meanwhile the program creates a bunch of invisible CMD tabs that print thousands of random numbers to crash the computer.

I will include an antivirus batch file to stop the program at any point.  Be sure to run it a second time after it haults the program to clean up any CMD tabs that may have slipped through.
This is 100% harmless as long as you either reboot the computer or run the antivirus twice.
This is designed to remain harmless, so if you choose to edit, understand that whatever happens to the computer is on you.

How to use: 
Extract the ZIP folder anywhere you like, just keep all contents in the folder, or the program won't work.
Create a shortcut on your desktop and link it to the file named "WemenStart" then copy the name of the internet browser you want to replicate.
Right click the shortcut you want to replicate, go to properties, then click change icon. From here you can copy the path of the icon used and paste it in the shortcut you created.

Keep in mind: The shortcut will open google.com in your default search engine upon the first click. Then nothing will happen for 30 seconds.

Order of flow between files:
1- The shortcut you created will open WemenStart.vbs
2- WemenStart.vbs will open google.com, then start WemenSt.bat
3- WemenSt.bat waits 30 seconds, then starts WemenMsg.vbs
4- WemenMsg.vbs creates an error pop up and opens windows support. This pop up doesn't go away. While this is happening, the file opens Timer.bat
5- Timer.bat waits 10 seconds before running Tab_Opener
6- Tab_Opener repeatedly creates Crash.bat programs that run invisibly
7- A single Crash.bat program logs random numbers it creates until it is stopped
